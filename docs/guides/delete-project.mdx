You can delete an Ory Network project by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh).
2. Create a workspace API key for the workspace your project is in.
3. Copy the project ID from the project settings page.
4. Run the following cURL command:
   ```bash
   curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.console.ory.sh/projects/${ORY_PROJECT_ID}' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${WORKSPACE_API_KEY}' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json'
   ```
